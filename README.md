# Books
Welcome to the Github repository for the Books.
In order to make sure we are all up to date with the books, we will be using Git and Github.

When updating files, save a copy in case pulling overwrites the file.
Always git pull before pushing edits.

PROCEDURE:
cd documents/'file name'
git pull
Rectify changes if necessary
git add 'File Name.docx'
git commit -m 'Changes made'
git push

Following this procedure should avoid any problems
